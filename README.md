   -  [Amazon top 50 selling books - ](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019.ipynb): This project consists of finding the detail of the amazon top 50 books such as price, user ratings and reviews.
   -  [Indian_education_system_EDA - ](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/Indian_Education_System.ipynb): This project contains information about Indian School Education Statistics of the year 2013-2014 to 2015-2016.The project tells us about the number of the student dropout according to the different state and dropout ratio for the state in the country. At the same time the  enrollment ratio of the student for the state in our country 
   -  [Uber Data analysis using Python -](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/Code%20file/Uber%20data%20analysisi.ipynb): This purpose of this projects is to find the difference between the cab rental rates in normal days and in the rainy days.This project gives the better understanding of the cab rental rates on the basis of the weather reports 
   -  [Indian_food_EDA -](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/indian-food-101%20(2).ipynb):The purpose of this projects is to find cooking time taken by the dishes after the order is place. This project consists of 255 indian dishes.

- ## Data Mining And EDA Projects
   -  [IPL data -](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/Code%20file/ipl2017.ipynb):The purpose of this project is find out the number of the participate in the IPL 2017.The number of the match win and lose by each participating team.Number of the innings played by each participating team in the IPL 2017
   -  [covid -]():
   -  [Exploratory Data Analytics on Pima Indians Diabetes Database -](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_pima_diabetes.ipynb):This project consists of  Pima Indian Diabetes Database is from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It consists of nine variables, out of which 'outcome' is the target variable. The objective of this project is to aid in predicting if a person is likely to have Diabetes or not.
   -  [Exploratory Data Analysis on Automobile dataset -](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_Automobile_dataset_(2).ipynb):This project consists of three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics (b) its assigned insurance risk rating (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process "symboling". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
   -  [Salary_expectation_based_on_experiences -](https://github.com/kartikshastrakar/kartik/blob/main/Salary_expectation_based_on_experiences.ipynb):The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type. ... This model can be used as a guide when determining salaries since it shows reasonable predictions when given information on years of experience, job type
